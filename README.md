An android application that talks to a UPC database through an API. It also uzes the zxing library to acquire barcodes.

## Inspiration

My pantry back at home is simply a mess. It's not organized in any shape or form, and I don't really know what I have. I walk into the grocery store, wondering if I should buy some dried beans or some canned soup, only to realize when I get home that I already had them.
## What it does

This app helps you keep track of what you have - and is able to easily filter through your inventory. This way, you will know exactly what you have in your pantry, without having to dig through its depths.
## How I built it

I used eclipse with the android SDT, as well as my Galaxy S3, and the zxing library for barcode scanning. I also paired this together with an online UPC database which I query.
